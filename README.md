# Windows Forms Blazor Hybrid App Template
A Basic setup for a Winforms Blazor hybrid app
- Aim of this template is to allow the directory where the Exe is located to be clean.
- All resources are moved to `appdata/{projectName}/Resources` on start

# To Use
- `dotnet new install CWXDEV.Templates::1.1.0`

# TODO:
- change the `debugMode` to be a region
- change the CDN for a font to be local, if this is a concern
