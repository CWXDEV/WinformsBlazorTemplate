# Windows Forms Blazor Hybrid App Template
A Basic setup for a Winforms Blazor hybrid app

# To Use
- I'm unsure how to make this a proper template.

### Option 1
1. download the zip in releases
2. extract zip to `%userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Templates\ProjectTemplates`
3. start visual studio and select `WinformsBlazorTemplate`

### Option 2
1. clone the project and make the changes below aswell as the project name itself

# Changes needed once a project is created
1. search for `$safeprojectname$`, if you find any of these, replace them with your projects name.
2. search for `WinformsBlazorTemplate`, this will also need to be replaced with your projects name.
3. `app.ico` is just a placeholder, replace this with whatever you want

# TODO:
- change the `debugMode` to be a region
- change the CDN for a font to be local, if this is a concern
